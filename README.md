# Football Player Position Prediction (FIFA Dataset)⚽️
- In this project, we predict a FIFA player's position based on their skill levels, attributes and personal information. 
- Our data is adopted from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset) and uploaded [here](https://github.com/samyak24jain/fifa-player-position-prediction/tree/main/fifadataset). 
- We use the **FIFA-19 data for training** and **FIFA-20 data for testing**. 
- We train multiple **Multi Layer Perceptron** models (**simple artificial neural networks**) **with and without Regularization** to understand the difference in performance. The Regularization techniques used are **Early Stopping** and **Dropout Layer**.
